üïπÔ∏è How to Play Assembly: Endgame
Your mission is to guess a hidden programming-related word (like React, Python, etc.).

You have 3 attempts to correctly guess the word.

Select letters from the keyboard shown on the screen:

If your guessed letter is in the word, it will reveal itself in the blank spaces.

If the letter is not in the word, you lose one attempt.

Letter colors will guide you:

üü© Green: Correct guess

üü• Red: Incorrect guess

Win the game by guessing all letters correctly before you run out of attempts.

Lose the game if you run out of attempts before completing the word.

After a win or a loss, the game automatically restarts with a new word after a short delay.

You can also click the "New Game" button anytime to manually restart.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
